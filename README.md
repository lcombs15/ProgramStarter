# ProgramStarter
Hit the ground running: start the programs you need with one click.

## Functionality
Do you have an ever-growing list of programs you need to have open at any given moment?

Say you need 10 programs open for work. Do you ever accidentally close one or two of them?

With ***ProgramStarter*** any program listed in ```tasks.json``` is opened **only** if it isn't already open!
